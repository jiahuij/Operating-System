# Operating-System

1) The PurposeTo familiarize youwith the pthread_create(), pthread_join(), and pthread_exit() functionsby writinga program 
inC orC++ running in the Debian VM environment to sort a list of evennumber of integers in nondecreasingorder using the sorting
algorithm of your own choice.(2) The ProblemSort a list of even number of integers in nondecreasingorder using threethreads,
among which two of them are sortingthreads responsible for sorting each of the two sublists, while the third thread 
(i.e.the mergingthread) is responsible for merging the twosortedsublists into a single sorted list. You mayassume that the total
number of integers in the list is less than or equal to 20.(3) The ApproachCreate a global array shared betweenthe two sorting threads,
each of which will work on half of thearray. A second global array of the same sizecan be used by the two sorting threads to store 
their sorted subarrays there. The merging thread then merges the two sorted subarrays into a sorted sequenceby using eitherthe first
global arrayto store the result or a third global array to do it.This programming project will require passing parameters to each of
thetwosorting threads. In particular, it will be necessary to identify the starting index from which each threadis to begin sorting. 
The mainthread will output the sorted array once allthreads have exited.The input data should be stored in a file named p2data.txt. 
The input filenameshould be hard coded in your program. Each line in the input file should contain exactly one integer. The sorted 
list should be displayed on the screen with each line containing exactly one inte
