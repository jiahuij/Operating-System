# Operating-System

(1) The PurposeTo familiarize youwith the fork(), exec(), wait(), and exit() Linux system calls by writinga simple Linux shellin
C++that can run system programs.(2) Shell SpecificationTo make your life easier and reduce your effort on scanning and parsing the 
shell commands, you may assumethatall commands entered at the promptare syntactically correct. In other words, you do not have to verify
if a command entered by a user is valid or not.(2.1) The Shell Language(2.1.1) The Lexical StructureThe input to the shell is a sequence 
of lines.Each line consists of tokens. Tokens are separated by one or more spaces. A line may contain as many tokens asa command is 
allowed to have.There is only one kindof tokens: words.Awordcan be either a command or an argument associated with a command.(2.1.2) 
Parsing the Shell LanguageA line of input represents atoken group.Each token group will result in the shell forking a new process and
then executing the process.e.g. cat –n myfile.txt// a token groupEvery token group must begin with a word that is called the 
command(see example above). The words immediately following a command are calledarguments(e.g. there are two arguments for the 
catcommand above).A command may be followed bynone, one, or more argumentsas the command allows to have.
Page 2of 3(2.1.3) Some Examples of Shell Commandsls: a token groupcontaining onetoken(i.e.a command)ls -l: a token group
containing two tokens (i.e.a command and an argument)sort infile: a tokengroup containingtwo tokens (i.e.acommand and an argument)
dir: a token group containingonly one token (i.e.a command)sort –dinfile: atoken group containingthree tokens
(i.e.a command and two arguments)cat infile: a token group containing two tokens (i.e.a command and an argument)
(3) Interpreting the Shell LanguageLines of input areinterpretedonce their tokens are correctly extracted.
Your shell should first print a # sign to the screen representing a prompt and waitthere until the user types in a command. 
Your shell then spawns a child process to carry out the command.When yourshell finishes processingthe current line, 
it prints a # sign again to the screen waiting for the user to type in another command.This process is repeated until 
the user pressesCtrl-Cto terminate your shell.Every commandis to be interpreted as a valid Linux executable to be executed.
All commands areassumed to be in the current directory.After interpreting a command, the shell should wait for the forked
processto terminate before processingthe next line of input
